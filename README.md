## Multimodal LLMs with Database Constrained Decoding for Recycling Classification
**Andrew Luo**

This repo includes the code for the project Multimodal LLMs with Database Constrained Decoding for Recycling Classification.

We investigate the usefulness of multimodal LLMs for the task of visual recycling classification. We include utilities for our newly proposed method, **database constrained decoding**, an inference-time technique that enables a multimodal LLM to select the most likely database item given an image input. We also include our **Waste Wizard Dataset** at [this HuggingFace url](https://huggingface.co/datasets/acluous/waste-wizard-materials-list). The dataset contains city recycling databases spanning three different countries as well as an evaluation set of images labeled with the corresponding database item for each city.
